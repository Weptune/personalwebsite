          I’m Abhinav. This place is a small, quiet corner of the internet
          where I keep track of the things that won’t leave my head—albums and
          films I love (or struggle with), projects I’m building, and thoughts
          that don’t quite fit anywhere else.
        </p>
        <p>
          The site is intentionally minimal: mostly black and white, with just
          enough structure to get out of the way of the words. If you’re here,
          you’re welcome to wander—start with the <Link href="/albums" underline
            >album reviews</Link
          >, fall into a <Link href="/movies" underline>movie</Link> or two, or
          browse the <Link href="/projects" underline>projects</Link> I’m
          currently obsessed with.
        </p>
        <p>
          This will keep changing as I do. For now, think of it as a living
          notebook rather than a finished portfolio.

          You can usually find my code on <Link
            href="https://github.com/"
            external
            underline>GitHub</Link
          > and my half-formed takes scattered across this site.
