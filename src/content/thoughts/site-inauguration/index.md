Ever since my very 1st semester of college (I'm currently in my 6th), every other month or so, I've made a half hearted attempt to create my own personal website.

One that truly stands for who I am, one where I can showcase all my interests and thoughts, basically just a "hub" of ,,, me.

Hopefully, this website is it. A culmination of everything that I am.

For now I've only added albums/movies i consider a 10/10 or a 100/100. I will be writing reviews for them when I find the time to. I also intend to rate and review every album/movie I consume in the future. If there are any of em that you want me to review, I'm more than willing to.

I intend to keep this updated regularly, and post any and every thought I have that I gauge worth sharing. Always feel free to leave any comments in the GuestBook, regarding any media recommendations, feedback, ideas, or even messages to me.
