Made a ton of changes/additions since I first opened the website, thought I should document them. Hopefully this DevBlog will become a regular series in the future

## Changes

- The background was too static, and had more of a "snowy" vibe than a "starry" one. Hopefully the new site gives off the aesthetic of a starry night more
- Added dates for my reviews, this also means that the most recent albums/movies that ive reviewed shows up at the top. Before this it was just based on how it was stored in my folder, which was really dumb lol
- Added a search feature to movies/albums, so you can just search for reviews you wanna read
- The text was a little tough to read in contrast to the background, added a glow for better readability. It might be a lil too much, gimme feedback, thought it'd go well with the theme of the site even if it was a little too strong

## Additions

- BIG ONE. Click the "in the mood for stargazing?" text in the home page :3
- Added 52 new albums, all with a rating of 90-100. I have 300+ more to add 😭, and yes i gotta add them all manually. Yes that is how I added them rn. Yes I wanted to kms afterwards.
- The albums and movies tabs also has pages now, before that it was just one continous list. 10 of them per page
- There are shooting stars with random trajectories that show up in the background every time you click a tab :D
- I TRIED to add a feature where you can enter your email and subscribe to this page, getting notified every time I post a thought but

1. Does anybody even want that 😭
2. I COULD NOT GET IT TO WORK. WHY ARE THIRD PARTY SERVICES SUCH A NIGHTMARE TO IMPLEMENT. I SPENT 3 HOURS TRYING TO GET SUCH A BASIC TASK TO WORK THROUGH ZAPIER AND I JUST COULDNT. I hate technology. I hate coding. I hate everything

There's prob more that I've forgotten about, but that's all for now

## Notes

- I've honestly had a lot of fun making this site, but its basically all I've been doing for the past week. I have midsems coming up, might not update it for a couple of weeks, esp because I wont be listening to/watching a ton of new stuff anyway. PLEASEEEEEE give feedback no matter how negative it might be
- The poll, and the guestbook (SINCE THEY ARE CONNECTED TO A 3RD PARTY SERVICE, YOU KNOW HOW THAT GOES) can be laggy at times. I've no clue how to fix it, or if I even can without changing what service I use, and I've spent too much time getting it set up, you guys will just have to deal with its inconsistency sorry :P

Yeah thats about it um thanks for reading
